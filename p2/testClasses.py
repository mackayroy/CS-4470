"""Test classes for the Pacman AI projects.

This module provides the core testing infrastructure used in the autograding system.
It defines base classes for questions and test cases that are used to evaluate
student submissions. The testing framework supports different types of tests
and grading criteria through an extensible class hierarchy.

Originally developed at UC Berkeley for CS188 Intro to AI.
Modified by George Rudolph on 12 Nov 2024:
- Added type hints throughout the codebase
- Improved documentation and docstrings
- Verified compatibility with Python 3.13
