"""Core game logic and mechanics for the classic Pacman game.

This module implements the main game engine and mechanics for Pacman, including game state
management, movement rules, collision detection, and scoring. It is organized into three
main sections:

1. Pacman World Interface:
   Core classes and methods for interacting with the game environment, including the
   GameState class that tracks the full game state. This section contains the essential
   code needed for implementing Pacman agents.

2. Game Mechanics:
   Internal logic that governs game rules, movement validation, collision handling,
   and other core game behaviors. This section manages the underlying game mechanics
   but generally doesn't need to be modified.

3. Game Framework:
   Setup and initialization code for starting new games, processing command line options,
   and connecting the various game components (agents, graphics, etc). This section
   handles the game's execution flow.

To play the game manually:
    python pacman.py
Use WASD or arrow keys to move Pacman.

class GameState:
    """
    A GameState specifies the full game state, including the food, capsules,
    agent configurations and score changes.

    GameStates are used by the Game object to capture the actual state of the game and
    can be used by agents to reason about the game.

    Much of the information in a GameState is stored in a GameStateData object.  We
    strongly suggest that you access that data via the accessor methods below rather
    than referring to the GameStateData object directly.

    Note that in classic Pacman, Pacman is always agent 0.
