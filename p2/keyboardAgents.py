"""keyboardAgents.py - Keyboard Control Agents for Pacman
=======================================================

This module provides agents that can be controlled via keyboard input.
It includes two agent classes:
- KeyboardAgent: Uses WASD/arrow keys for control
- KeyboardAgent2: Uses IJKL keys for control (for 2-player games)

Usage:
    These agents allow human players to control Pacman via keyboard.
    They can be selected when launching the game.
