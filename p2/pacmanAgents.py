"""Pacman agent implementations for the Berkeley AI projects.

This module provides different Pacman agent implementations with varying strategies,
from simple rule-based agents like LeftTurnAgent to more sophisticated agents like
GreedyAgent that use evaluation functions to select actions.

Originally developed at UC Berkeley for CS188 Intro to AI.
Modified by George Rudolph on 12 Nov 2024:
- Added type hints throughout the codebase
- Improved documentation and docstrings 
- Verified compatibility with Python 3.13
