"""Text-based display implementation for the Pacman AI projects.

This module provides text-based visualization capabilities for the Pacman game,
including a null display that performs no visualization and a basic ASCII display.
It's useful for debugging or when graphical display is not needed or available.

Originally developed at UC Berkeley for CS188 Intro to AI.
Modified by George Rudolph on 12 Nov 2024:
- Added type hints throughout the codebase
- Improved documentation and docstrings
- Verified compatibility with Python 3.13
