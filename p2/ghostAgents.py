"""Ghost agents module for Pacman game.

This module provides ghost agent implementations for the Pacman game, including
base ghost behavior and specific ghost types like random ghosts.

Modified by: George Rudolph at Utah Valley University
Date: 22 Nov 2024

Updates:
- Added comprehensive docstrings with Args/Returns sections
- Added type hints throughout module
- Improved code organization and readability
- Added constants type annotations
- Added return type hints for all functions
- Added parameter type hints for all functions
- Python 3.13 compatibility verified
