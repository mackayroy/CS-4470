"""Test classes for evaluating multi-agent search algorithms.

Modified by George Rudolph, 12 Nov 2024
Changes:
1. Added type hints
2. Improved docstrings
3. Improved code organization

This module provides test infrastructure for evaluating student implementations of
multi-agent search algorithms like minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax.

The module includes test classes that:
- Create game tree structures for testing search algorithms
- Run student agents on small test cases with known solutions 
- Evaluate agent performance in full Pacman games
- Check for common implementation bugs and failure modes
- Support automated grading by comparing against reference solutions

Classes:
    MultiagentTreeState: A wrapper around game states that implements a simple tree
        structure for testing purposes
    MultiagentTreeProblem: A test problem that uses a tree of states/actions
    GraphGameTreeTest: Tests student agents on small game trees with known solutions
    PacmanGameTreeTest: Tests student agents by running them in Pacman games
    EvalAgentTest: Tests student agents by evaluating their performance metrics
    GradingAgent: Agent that grades student implementations
    PolyAgent: Composite agent that runs multiple test variations

Functions:
    parseTreeProblem: Parses a game tree problem from a test dictionary
    run: Runs multiple games and returns statistics

Usage:
    This module is used by the autograder to test student implementations of
    multi-agent search algorithms. It is not meant to be used directly.
