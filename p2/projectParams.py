"""Project parameters for the Pacman AI multiagent search project.

This module defines configuration parameters used by the autograder and testing
framework for Project 2, which focuses on multiagent search algorithms. It specifies
the default student code file, test classes, project name and other settings needed
for running and grading the project.

Originally developed at UC Berkeley for CS188 Intro to AI.
Modified by George Rudolph on 12 Nov 2024:
