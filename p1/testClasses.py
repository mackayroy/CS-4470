"""Test classes for grading student project submissions.

This module provides base classes and utilities for implementing test cases
and grading student project submissions. It includes classes for representing
questions, test cases, and managing test execution and grading.

The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley. The core projects and
autograders were primarily created by John DeNero (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and
Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu). Student side autograding was added by
Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and Pieter Abbeel (pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu).
